In this project, I created a Microsoft Access database for a realestate company using VBA and SQLServer. 

## Description

The program stores the data necessary for the company to run and is a platform to perform the tasks that the company would need to do.
- Stores and Updates, with proper data integrity, neccessary data about Clients
- Stores and Updates, with appropriate integrity, neccesary data about Agents
- Stores information about past showings and transactions with information about current standings and holdings
- Stores information about properties and notifies whether or not they are for sale
- Can create reports on all of the information above

## Accessing the Database

To access the Database, download the attachment and open it in Microsoft Access.
